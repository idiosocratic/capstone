# capstone for udacity
In this capstone I'll be creating several varied agents to solve a reinforcement learning environment in OpenAi's Gym suite. In particular I hope to showcase a policy gradient neural network, a nearest neighbor impliementation, and a simple parameter search. We'll compare the pro's and con's of these implimentations with each other.
